Car price prediction is somehow interesting and popular problem. As per information that was gotten from used car price prediction - Hackathon vehicles were registered in 2003 from which 84% of them are cars for personal usage. This number is increased by 2.7% since 2013 and it is likely that this trend will continue, and the number of cars will increase in future. This adds additional significance to the problem of the car price prediction. 
                      Accurate car price prediction involves expert knowledge, because price usually depends on many distinctive features and factors. Typically, most significant ones are brand and model, age, horsepower and mileage. The fuel type used in the car as well as fuel consumption per mile highly affect price of a car due to a frequent changes in the price of a fuel. Different features like exterior color, door number, type of transmission, dimensions, safety, air condition, interior, whether it has navigation or not will also influence the car price. In this paper, we applied different methods and techniques in order to achieve higher precision of the used car price predict
                      

   The objective of this paper is to find the used car price in India with the help of supervised learning 
Here we used to fit the models by different algorithm with the help of classification and regression
From that algorithm we will compare the accuracy of the model and finally we will go through the best model with respect to the accuracy of the model for the used car price prediction
